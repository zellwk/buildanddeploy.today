### Unfortunately, there's a steep learning curve — although it's not as steep as learning Wordpress or another CMS

There is a steep learning curve for someone who's going from basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to building a website with a Static Site Generator.

**There are four major blockage points:**

1. You have to choose a Static Site Generator
2. You have to learn to use that Static Site Generator
3. You have to figure out the quirks of that Static Site Generator (to use it however you want).
4. You have to learn about SEO — which is especially scary if you've never done it before.

**But Static Site Generators are absolutely worthwhile for three reasons**:

1. They're easier to learn compared to things like Wordpress
2. You get full control (and flexibility) over your code (and design!)
3. You can learn it once and use it forever

**It's a worthwhile investment because they let you build sites with a much better experience as a developer** (and hint: they also let you build sites that provide a much better experience than what Wordpress can give).

### Choosing a Static Site Generator

When you choose a Static Site Generator, you have to look at how they're used in two phases:

- Building the website itself — Building
- Readying the website for production — Optimization

Some Static Site Generators are written in a language you're not familiar with — like Ruby or Go. Do you _want_ to learn a new language to use a Static Site Generator? _Hell no_!

Which Static Site Generator helps you out the most during your build phase? Which one is easier for Optimization?

- Astro has all the tools you need built into the system — including Sass and Autoprefixer. It lets you play around with major JavaScript frameworks and use them however you want!
- Eleventy, on the other hand, doesn't handle your asset pipeline so you have to write a custom Gulp script to make things work.

Which would you choose? Astro, obviously. But do you know what you choose before you read this?

That's precisely my point — you need to do a lot of research to figure things out; you have to spend a lot of time murking around the documentation. But you don't have the time nor energy to do that.

This is where I come in. I figured it out and I'm here to help you get up to speed quickly.

**I have been building websites with Static Site Generators for years.** I spent hundreds of hours digging into documentation and building stuff. I know what to watch out for. I also know what to teach you to create a robust Static Site Generator.

I'm excited to show you how to use Astro to build your website. **I want to show you the system I use — which is so good that a client paid me \$2000 to to port over her website from Wordpress to my system.**

The best part is this client is not a developer. She doesn't know how to code. So the system I'm going to show you is so easy that a non-coder can use it too. Imagine what you can do with it.

### SEO is not hard

SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization.

People who are switching over from CMSes like Wordpress to Static Site Generators have a fear of screwing up SEO. And that's understandable.

If you screw up SEO, your site doesn't get listed on search engines like Google. Screwing up is bad because you want people to find your website!

The truth is: SEO is not as hard as you think. You just need to get a few things right. I'll show you how to do these in the system I'm teaching you.

**I know what I'm doing: 1 million people visited my website in 2021**. It's not _that_ much compared to the big names, but it's sufficient enough to prove that I know some SEO chops—that you may miss when you're building your own Static website.
