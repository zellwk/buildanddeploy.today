# Frequently Asked Questions

### When will registration end?

Please enroll by Monday, May 23, 2359pm PST if you want to join this workshop series. _We do not accept late enrollments._

Registration ends on Monday because I know some people don't check emails on the weekends. I'm holding the registration open till Monday so you can join if you're one of these people.

Here's a link to join the workshop series

### Will the workshop be recorded?

_YES. The workshop will be recorded_. We will put the recording up a couple of days after the live session. You can watch the replays anytime. You also get to keep the replays for as long as you want to. So you don't have to worry about making time for all 8 sessions in your calendar.

Attend what you can, and watch the rest on replay!

### Can I get a discount since the exchange rate is bad for my country?

No. We are not doing any further discounts. \$49 for 8 workshops is already a HUGE offer.

### What's the catch? Why make it so cheap?

There's no catch. I simply want to show you the best way to build websites (in my opinion). I want to give you the power to make websites quickly and easily—so you can go out there and make magic for yourself and for the world.

### What if I want a refund?

This is a live workshop so we do not accept refunds. Please consider whether the workshop is valuable for you before you join.

### I still have questions

We don't have enough time for me to talk about all the wonderful things the system gives you before registration closes! So if you have any further questions or concerns before joining the workshops, [email me](https://zellwk.com/contact) and let me know.

I'll try to cover your questions as much as I can over the next three days.

That's it for the FAQ!

I'm pumped to show you my Static Site Generator system :)

By the way, I don't think you'll be able to find another workshop that gives you so much explosive possibility and power at such a low price point. **This is my gift to you.**

I hope you take it.

Can’t wait to see you.
