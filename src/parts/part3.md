Introducing Build and Deploy
</h1>

**In Build and Deploy, I want to show you my latest system — the easiest way to build a real website and put it up on the internet.** You can hear more about the course through these two videos.

**Build and Deploy going to be an 8-session workshop, held each Friday.** Each session is going to be 1.5 hours long. You will get 1 hour of content (where I live-code the system for you) and 30 minutes of Q&A.

I'm expecting to finish the system by Session 4. In Sessions 5 to 8, I will be building systems to answer the questions you have.

By the end of this series of workshops, you will have enough knowledge about Static Site Generators to go out there and do magic.

**The dates for the workshops are as follows:**

- 27 May, Friday at 10am Singapore Time
- 3 June, Friday, 10am Singapore Time
- 10 June, Friday, 10am Singapore Time
- 17 June, Friday, 10am Singapore Time
- 24 June, Friday, 10am Singapore Time
- 1 July, Friday, 10am Singapore Time
- 8 July, Friday, 10am Singapore Time
- 15 July, Friday, 10am Singapore Time

**Here's the tentative lesson plan.** Actual lessons may change depending on how the workshops go.

- **Session 1:** Introduction to the system (and the essential stuff)
- **Session 2:** SEO
- **Session 3:** CSS
- **Session 4:** Building Reusable Components
- **Session 5:** Asset Management and JavaScript
- **Session 6:** Using a Content Management System
- **Session 7:** Advanced Astro & Netlify stuff
- **Session 8:** To be determined

## Pricing information — what you've been waiting for

**How much would one normally charge for 8 workshops?**

I want you to think of a reasonable number.

Bear in mind he system I'm teaching you has earned me $100,000+ from selling courses so far. It has also earned me $2000 from client work.

Have a number yet?

Well, you won't believe the number I'm giving you.

**I'm only charging \$49 for this series of 8 workshops.**

Why so cheap?

I only have one reason.

Being able to code turned my life around. Before I started coding, I felt I was a useless person who has no skills and couldn't contribute to my future in any way.

Magical things began to happen when I started coding. I was sought after for my coding abilities, and I was given opportunities, even though I'm new to code!

My passion became learning to help people code. I want to give you the knowledge to grasp the power you have — to build websites, to create magic, to reach for a better life.

**My goal is to empower you**, my friend, to go out there and build things and make a god damn good living as a developer.

That's why I'm selling it at such a low price.
